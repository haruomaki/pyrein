# pyrein

PyRein is a framework for building games as discrete environments with real-time rendering and interchangeable inputs.

In pyrein, S denotes the state of the system, and M denotes an abstract message that drives state transitions.
M may represent user input, agent actions, events, or any external manipulation.
